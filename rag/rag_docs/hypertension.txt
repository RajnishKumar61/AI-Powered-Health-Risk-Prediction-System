Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition where systolic blood pressure is consistently above 140 mmHg
or diastolic blood pressure is above 90 mmHg.
Risk factors include obesity, high salt intake, lack of physical activity, stress, smoking, and genetic predisposition.
Hypertension often has no noticeable symptoms but increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease.
Long-term uncontrolled hypertension can damage blood vessels and vital organs.
Lifestyle changes such as reduced salt intake, regular exercise, and weight control play a major role in management.
Early detection and consistent monitoring are critical to prevent complications.
