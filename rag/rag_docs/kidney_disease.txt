Kidney disease occurs when the kidneys lose their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.
Elevated creatinine levels and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are key indicators of kidney dysfunction.
Diabetes and hypertension are the leading causes of chronic kidney disease.
Early stages may be asymptomatic, while advanced stages can cause swelling, fatigue, and reduced urine output.
Persistent kidney damage can lead to the need for dialysis or transplantation.
Early detection, blood sugar control, and blood pressure management help slow disease progression.
