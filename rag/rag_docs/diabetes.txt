Diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition characterized by persistently high blood glucose levels.
Blood glucose values above 200 mg/dL and HbA1c levels greater than 6.5 percent are strong indicators of diabetes risk.
Common risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary habits, family history, and increasing age.
Symptoms may include excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss.
Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems.
Lifestyle modification, regular monitoring, and early medical intervention can significantly reduce long-term complications.
